# TorchMorph

> âš¡ CUDA-Accelerated, Batch-Parallel Morphological Transformations for PyTorch

TorchMorph is a lightweight, extensible library that brings **GPU-accelerated morphological operations** into the PyTorch ecosystem.  
It provides a **clean Python API** backed by **custom CUDA kernels**, enabling highly efficient, **batch-parallel** transformations for real-time and large-scale vision tasks.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- âš¡ **CUDA Acceleration** â€“ All operators are implemented with native CUDA kernels for maximum throughput.  
- ðŸ§© **Seamless PyTorch Integration** â€“ Accepts and returns `torch.Tensor` objects, fully compatible with autograd and CUDA streams.  
- ðŸ§  **Highly Batch-Parallel** â€“ Optimized to process large batches and multi-dimensional inputs concurrently.  
- ðŸ§± **Modular Design** â€“ Each operation is isolated in its own kernel, making it easy to add or extend transformations.  
- âœ… **Lightweight & Self-Contained** â€“ No third-party dependencies beyond PyTorch and a working CUDA toolkit.
